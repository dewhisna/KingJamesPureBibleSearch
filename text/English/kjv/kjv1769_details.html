<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Zeal
to promote the common good, whether it be by devising anything
ourselves, or revising that which hath been laboured by others,
deserveth certainly much respect and esteem, but yet findeth but cold
entertainment in the world.  It is welcomed with suspicion instead of
love, and with emulation instead of thanks: and if there be any hole
left for cavil to enter, (and cavil, if it do not find a hole, will
make one) it is sure to be misconstrued, and in danger to be
condemned.  This will easily be granted by as many as know story, or
have any experience.  For, was there ever any-projected, that
savoured any way of newness or renewing, but the same endured many a
storm of gainsaying, or opposition?  A man would think that Civility,
wholesome Laws, learning and eloquence, Synods, and
Church-maintenance, (that we speak of no more things of this kind)
should be as safe as a Sanctuary, and out of shot, as they say, that
no man would lift up the heel, no, nor dog move his tongue against
the motioners of them. For by the first, we are distinguished from
brute beasts lead with sensuality; By the second, we are bridled and
restrained from outrageous behaviour, and from doing of injuries,
whether by fraud or by violence; By the third, we are enabled to
inform and reform others, by the light and feeling that we have
attained unto ourselves; Briefly, by the fourth being brought
together to a parley face to face, we sooner compose our differences
than by writings which are endless; And lastly, that the Church be
sufficiently provided for, is so agreeable to good reason and
conscience, that those mothers are holden to be less cruel, that kill
their children as soon as they are born, than those nursing fathers
and mothers (wheresoever they be) that withdraw from them who hang
upon their breasts (and upon whose breasts again themselves do hang
to receive the Spiritual and sincere milk of the word) livelihood and
support fit for their estates.  Thus it is apparent, that these
things which we speak of, are of most necessary use, and therefore,
that none, either without absurdity can speak against them, or
without note of wickedness can spurn against them.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><span lang="en-US">Yet
for all that, the learned know that certain worthy men [Anacharsis
with others] have been brought to untimely death for none other
fault, but for seeking to reduce their Countrymen to god order and
discipline; and that in some Commonwealths [e.g. Locri] it was made a
capital crime, once to motion the making of a new Law for the
abrogating of an old, though the same were most pernicious; And that
certain [Cato the elder], which would be counted pillars of the
State, and patterns of Virtue and Prudence, could not be brought for
a long time to give way to good Letters and refined speech, but bare
themselves as averse from them, as from rocks or boxes of poison; And
fourthly, that he was no babe, but a great clerk [Gregory the
Divine], that gave forth (and in writing to remain to posterity) in
passion peradventure, but yet he gave forth, that he had not seen any
profit to come by any Synod, or meeting of the Clergy, but rather the
contrary; And lastly, against Church-maintenance and allowance, in
such sort, as the Ambassadors and messengers of the great King of
Kings should be furnished, it is not unknown what a fiction or fable
(so it is esteemed, and for no better by the reporter himself
[Nauclerus], though superstitious) was devised; Namely, that at such
a time as the professors and teachers of Christianity in the Church
of Rome, then a true Church, were liberally endowed, a voice forsooth
was heard from heaven, saying:  Now is poison poured down into the
Church, etc.  Thus not only as oft as we speak, as one saith, but
also as oft as we do anything of note or consequence, we subject
ourselves to everyone's censure, and happy is he that is least tossed
upon tongues; for utterly to escape the snatch of them it is
impossible.  If any man conceit, that this is the lot and portion of
the meaner sort only, and that Princes are privileged by their high
estate, he is deceived.  &quot;As the sword devoureth as well one as
the other,&quot; as it is in Samuel [2 Sam 11:25], nay as the great
Commander charged his soldiers in a certain battle, to strike at no
part of the enemy, but at the face; And as the King of Syria
commanded his chief Captains to &quot;fight neither with small nor
great, save only against the King of Israel:&quot; [1 Kings 22:31] so
it is too true, that Envy striketh most spitefully at the fairest,
and at the chiefest.  David was a worthy Prince, and no man to be
compared to him for his first deeds, and yet for as worthy as act as
ever he did (even for bringing back the Ark of God in solemnity) he
was scorned and scoffed at by his own wife [2 Sam 6:16].  Solomon was
greater than David, though not in virtue, yet in power: and by his
power and wisdom he built a Temple to the Lord, such a one as was the
glory of the land of Israel, and the wonder of the whole world.  But
was that his magnificence liked of by all?  We doubt it.  Otherwise,
why do they lay it in his son's dish, and call unto him for easing
the burden, &quot;Make&quot;, say they, &quot;the grievous servitude
of thy father, and his sore yoke, lighter?&quot; [1 Kings 12:4] 
Belike he had charged them with some levies, and troubled them with
some carriages; Hereupon they raise up a tragedy, and wish in their
heart the Temple had never been built.  So hard a thing it is to
please all, even when we please God best, and do seek to approve
ourselves to every ones conscience.</span></font></font></p>

we will descend to later times, we shall find many the like examples
of such kind, or rather unkind acceptance.  The first Roman Emperor
[C. Caesar. Plutarch] did never do a more pleasing deed to the
learned, nor more profitable to posterity, for conserving the record
of times in true supputation; than when he corrected the Calendar,
and ordered the year according to the course of the Sun; and yet this
was imputed to him for novelty, and arrogance, and procured to him
great obloguy.  So the first Christened Emperor [Constantine] (at the
least-wise that openly professed the faith himself, and allowed
others to do the like) for strengthening the Empire at his great
charges, and providing for the Church, as he did, got for his labour
the name Pupillus, as who would say, a wasteful Prince, that had need
of a Guardian or overseer [Aurel. Victor].  So the best Christened
Emperor [Theodosius], for the love that he bare unto peace, thereby
to enrich both himself and his subjects, and because he did not see
war but find it, was judged to be no man at arms [Zosimus], (though
indeed he excelled in feats of chivalry, and showed so much when he
was provoked) and condemned for giving himself to his ease, and to
his pleasure.  To be short, the most learned Emperor of former times
[Justinian], (at the least, the greatest politician) what thanks had
he for cutting off the superfluities of the laws, and digesting them
into some order and method?  This, that he had been blotted by some
to be an Epitomist, that is, one that extinguishes worthy whole
volumes, to bring his abridgments into request.  This is the measure
that hath been rendered to excellent Princes in former times, even,
Cum bene facerent, male audire, For their good deeds to be evil
spoken of.  Neither is there any likelihood, that envy and malignity
died, and were buried with the ancient.  No, no, the reproof of Moses
taketh hold of most ages; &quot;You are risen up in your fathers'
stead, and increase of sinful men.&quot; [Num 32:14]  &quot;What is
that that hath been done? that which shall be done; and there is no
new thing under the Sun,&quot; saith the wiseman: [Ecc 1:9] and S.
Stephen, &quot;As your fathers did, so do you.&quot; [Acts 7:51]</font></font></p>

CULMINATION, FOR THE SURVEY OF THE ENGLISH TRANSLATIONS</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">This,
and more to this purpose, His Majesty that now reigneth (and long,
and long may he reign, and his offspring forever, &quot;Himself and
children, and children's always) knew full well, according to the
singular wisdom given unto him by God, and the rare learning and
experience that he hath attained unto; namely that whosoever
attempteth anything for the public (especially if it pertain to
Religion, and to the opening and clearing of the word of God) the
same setteth himself upon a stage to be gloated upon by every evil
eye, yea, he casteth himself headlong upon pikes, to be gored by
every sharp tongue.  For he that medleth with men's Religion in any
part, medleth with their custom, nay, with their freehold; and though
they find no content in that which they have, yet they cannot abide
to hear of altering.  Notwithstanding his Royal heart was not daunted
or discouraged for this that colour, but stood resolute, &quot;as a
statue immovable, and an anvil not easy to be beaten into plates,&quot;
as one [Suidas] saith; he knew who had chosen him to be a Soldier, or
rather a Captain, and being assured that the course which he intended
made for the glory of God, and the building up of his Church, he
would not suffer it to be broken off for whatsoever speeches or
practices.  It doth certainly belong unto Kings, yea, it doth
specially belong unto them, to have care of Religion, yea, it doth
specially belong unto them, to have care of Religion, yea, to know it
aright, yea, to profess it zealously, yea to promote it to the
uttermost of their power.  This is their glory before all nations
which mean well, and this will bring unto them a far most excellent
weight of glory in the day of the Lord Jesus.  For the Scripture
saith not in vain, &quot;Them that honor me, I will honor,&quot; [1
Sam 2:30] neither was it a vain word that Eusebius delivered long
ago, that piety towards God was the weapon and the only weapon, that
both preserved Constantine's person, and avenged him of his enemies
[Eusebius lib 10 cap 8].</font></font></p>

now what piety without truth? what truth (what saving truth) without
the word of God?  What word of God (whereof we may be sure) without
the Scripture?  The Scriptures we are commanded to search. John 5:39.
Isa 8:20.  They are commended that searched and studied them.  Acts
17:11 and 8:28,29.  They are reproved that were unskillful in them,
or slow to believe them.  Matt 22:29.  Luke 24:25.  They can make us
wise unto salvation. 2 Tim 3:15.  If we be ignorant, they will
instruct us; if out of the way, they will bring us home; if out of
order, they will reform us; if in heaviness, comfort us; if dull,
quicken us; if cold, inflame us.  Tolle, lege; Tolle, lege, Take up
and read, take up and read the Scriptures [S. August. confess. lib 8
cap 12], (for unto them was the direction) it was said unto S.
Augustine by a supernatural voice.  &quot;Whatsoever is in the
Scriptures, believe me,&quot; saith the same S. Augustine, &quot;is
high and divine; there is verily truth, and a doctrine most fit for
the refreshing of men's minds, and truly so tempered, that everyone
may draw from thence that which is sufficient for him, if he come to
draw with a devout and pious mind, as true Religion requireth.&quot;
[S. August. de utilitcredendi cap. 6]  Thus S. Augustine. and S.
Jerome: &quot;Ama scripturas, et amabit te sapientia etc.&quot; [S.
Jerome. ad Demetriad]  Love the Scriptures, and wisdom will love
thee.  And S. Cyril against Julian; &quot;Even boys that are bred up
in the Scriptures, become most religious, etc.&quot; [S. Cyril. 7
contra Iulianum]  But what mention we three or four uses of the
Scripture, whereas whatsoever is to be believed or practiced, or
hoped for, is contained in them? or three or four sentences of the
Fathers, since whosoever is worthy the name of a Father, from
Christ's time downward, hath likewise written not only of the riches,
but also of the perfection of the Scripture?  &quot;I adore the
fulness of the Scripture,&quot; saith Tertullian against Hermogenes.
[Tertul. advers. Hermo.]  And again, to Apelles an heretic of the
like stamp, he saith; &quot;I do not admit that which thou bringest
in (or concludest) of thine own (head or store, de tuo) without
Scripture.&quot; [Tertul. de carne Christi.]  So Saint Justin Martyr
before him; &quot;We must know by all means,&quot; saith he, &quot;that
it is not lawful (or possible) to learn (anything) of God or of right
piety, save only out of the Prophets, who teach us by divine
inspiration.&quot; So Saint Basil after Tertullian, &quot;It is a
manifest falling way from the Faith, and a fault of presumption,
either to reject any of those things that are written, or to bring in
(upon the head of them) any of those things that are not written.  We
omit to cite to the same effect, S. Cyril B. of Jerusalem in his
4::Cataches., Saint Jerome against Helvidius, Saint Augustine in his
3::book against the letters of Petilian, and in very many other
places of his works.  Also we forebear to descend to later Fathers,
because we will not weary the reader.  The Scriptures then being
acknowledged to be so full and so perfect, how can we excuse
ourselves of negligence, if we do not study them, of curiosity, if we
be not content with them?  Men talk much of [an olive bow wrapped
about with wood, whereupon did hang figs, and bread, honey in a pot,
and oil], how many sweet and goodly things it had hanging on it; of
the Philosopher's stone, that it turned copper into gold; of
Cornucopia, that it had all things necessary for food in it, of
Panaces the herb, that it was good for diseases, of Catholicon the
drug, that it is instead of all purges; of Vulcan's armor, that it
was an armor of proof against all thrusts, and all blows, etc.  Well,
that which they falsely or vainly attributed to these things for
bodily god, we may justly and with full measure ascribe unto the
Scripture, for spiritual.  It is not only an armor, but also a whole
armory of weapons, both offensive and defensive; whereby we may save
ourselves and put the enemy to flight.  It is not an herb, but a
tree, or rather a whole paradise of trees of life, which bring forth
fruit every month, and the fruit thereof is for meat, and the leaves
for medicine.  It is not a pot of Manna, or a cruse of oil, which
were for memory only, or for a meal's meat or two, but as it were a
shower of heavenly bread sufficient for a whole host, be it never so
great; and as it were a whole cellar full of oil vessels; whereby all
our necessities may be provided for, and our debts discharged.  In a
word, it is a Panary of wholesome food, against fenowed traditions; a
Physician's shop (Saint Basil called it) [S. Basil in Psal. primum.]
of preservatives against poisoned heresies; a Pandect of profitable
laws, against rebellious spirits; a treasury of most costly jewels,
against beggarly rudiments; finally a fountain of most pure water
springing up unto everlasting life.  And what marvel? The original
thereof being from heaven, not from earth; the author being God, not
man; the inditer, the holy spirit, not the wit of the Apostles or
Prophets; the Penmen such as were sanctified from the womb, and
endued with a principal portion of God's spirit; the matter, verity,
piety, purity, uprightness; the form, God's word, God's testimony,
God's oracles, the word of truth, the word of salvation, etc.; the
effects, light of understanding, stableness of persuasion, repentance
from dead works, newness of life, holiness, peace, joy in the holy
Ghost; lastly, the end and reward of the study thereof, fellowship
with the Saints, participation of the heavenly nature, fruition of an
inheritance immortal, undefiled, and that never shall fade away: 
Happy is the man that delighted in the Scripture, and thrice happy
that meditateth in it day and night.</span></font></font></p>

how shall men meditate in that, which they cannot understand? How
shall they understand that which is kept close in an unknown tongue?
as it is written, &quot;Except I know the power of the voice, I shall
be to him that speaketh, a Barbarian, and he that speaketh, shall be
a Barbarian to me.&quot; [1 Cor 14]  The Apostle excepteth no tongue;
not Hebrew the ancientest, not Greek the most copious, not Latin the
finest.  Nature taught a natural man to confess, that all of us in
those tongues which we do not understand, are plainly deaf; we may
turn the deaf ear unto them.  The Scythian counted the Athenian, whom
he did not understand, barbarous; [Clem. Alex. 1 Strom.] so the Roman
did the Syrian, and the Jew (even S. Jerome himself called the Hebrew
tongue barbarous, belike because it was strange to so many) [S.
Jerome. Damaso.] so the Emperor of Constantinople [Michael, Theophili
fil.] calleth the Latin tongue, barbarous, though Pope Nicolas do
storm at it: [2::Tom. Concil. ex edit. Petri Crab] so the Jews long
before Christ called all other nations, Lognazim, which is little
better than barbarous.  Therefore as one complaineth, that always in
the Senate of Rome, there was one or other that called for an
interpreter: [Cicero 5::de finibus.] so lest the Church be driven to
the like exigent, it is necessary to have translations in a
readiness.  Translation it is that openeth the window, to let in the
light; that breaketh the shell, that we may eat the kernel; that
putteth aside the curtain, that we may look into the most Holy place;
that removeth the cover of the well, that we may come by the water,
even as Jacob rolled away the stone from the mouth of the well, by
which means the flocks of Laban were watered [Gen 29:10].  Indeed
without translation into the vulgar tongue, the unlearned are but
like children at Jacob's well (which is deep) [John 4:11] without a
bucket or something to draw with; or as that person mentioned by
Isaiah, to whom when a sealed book was delivered, with this motion,
&quot;Read this, I pray thee,&quot; he was fain to make this answer,
&quot;I cannot, for it is sealed.&quot; [Isa 29:11]</font></font></p>

God would be known only in Jacob, and have his Name great in Israel,
and in none other place, while the dew lay on Gideon's fleece only,
and all the earth besides was dry; then for one and the same people,
which spake all of them the language of Canaan, that is, Hebrew, one
and the same original in Hebrew was sufficient. [S. August. lib 12
contra Faust c32]  But, when the fulness of time drew near, that the
Sun of righteousness, the Son of God should come into the world, whom
God ordained to be a reconciliation through faith in his blood, not
of the Jew only, but also of the Greek, yea, of all them that were
scattered abroad; then lo, it pleased the Lord to stir up the spirit
of a Greek Prince (Greek for descent and language) even of Ptolemy
Philadelph King of Egypt, to procure the translating of the Book of
God out of Hebrew into Greek.  This is the translation of the Seventy
Interpreters, commonly so called, which prepared the way for our
Saviour among the Gentiles by written preaching, as Saint John
Baptist did among the Jews by vocal.  For the Grecians being desirous
of learning, were not wont to suffer books of worth to lie moulding
in Kings' libraries, but had many of their servants, ready scribes,
to copy them out, and so they were dispersed and made common.  Again,
the Greek tongue was well known and made familiar to most inhabitants
in Asia, by reason of the conquest that there the Grecians had made,
as also by the Colonies, which thither they had sent. For the same
causes also it was well understood in many places of Europe, yea, and
of Africa too.  Therefore the word of God being set forth in Greek,
becometh hereby like a candle set upon a candlestick, which giveth
light to all that are in the house, or like a proclamation sounded
forth in the market place, which most men presently take knowledge
of; and therefore that language was fittest to contain the
Scriptures, both for the first Preachers of the Gospel to appeal unto
for witness, and for the learners also of those times to make search
and trial by.  It is certain, that that Translation was not so sound
and so perfect, but it needed in many places correction; and who had
been so sufficient for this work as the Apostles or Apostolic men? 
Yet it seemed good to the holy Ghost and to them, to take that which
they found, (the same being for the greatest part true and
sufficient) rather than making a new, in that new world and green age
of the Church, to expose themselves to many exceptions and
cavillations, as though they made a Translations to serve their own
turn, and therefore bearing a witness to themselves, their witness
not to be regarded.  This may be supposed to be some cause, why the
Translation of the Seventy was allowed to pass for current. 
Notwithstanding, though it was commended generally, yet it did not
fully content the learned, no not of the Jews.  For not long after
Christ, Aquila fell in hand with a new Translation, and after him
Theodotion, and after him Symmachus; yea, there was a fifth and a
sixth edition, the Authors whereof were not known. [Epiphan. de
mensur. et ponderibus.]  These with the Seventy made up the Hexapla
and were worthily and to great purpose compiled together by Origen. 
Howbeit the Edition of the Seventy went away with the credit, and
therefore not only was placed in the midst by Origen (for the worth
and excellency thereof above the rest, as Epiphanius gathered) but
also was used by the Greek fathers for the ground and foundation of
their Commentaries.  Yea, Epiphanius above named doeth attribute so
much unto it, that he holdeth the Authors thereof not only for
Interpreters, but also for Prophets in some respect [S. August. 2::de
dectrin. Christian c. 15]; and Justinian the Emperor enjoining the
Jews his subjects to use especially the Translation of the Seventy,
rendreth this reason thereof, because they were as it were
enlightened with prophetical grace.  Yet for all that, as the
Egyptians are said of the Prophet to be men and not God, and their
horses flesh and not spirit [Isa 31:3]; so it is evident, (and Saint
Jerome affirmeth as much) [S. Jerome. de optimo genere interpret.]
that the Seventy were Interpreters, they were not Prophets; they did
many things well, as learned men; but yet as men they stumbled and
fell, one while through oversight, another while through ignorance,
yea, sometimes they may be noted to add to the Original, and
sometimes to take from it; which made the Apostles to leave them many
times, when they left the Hebrew, and to deliver the sense thereof
according to the truth of the word, as the spirit gave them
utterance.  This may suffice touching the Greek Translations of the
Old Testament.</span></font></font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">There
were also within a few hundred years after CHRIST, translations many
into the Latin tongue: for this tongue also was very fit to convey
the Law and the Gospel by, because in those times very many Countries
of the West, yea of the South, East and North, spake or understood
Latin, being made Provinces to the Romans.  But now the Latin
Translations were too many to be all good, for they were infinite
(Latini Interprets nullo modo numerari possunt, saith S. Augustine.)
[S. Augustin. de doctr. Christ. lib 2 cap II].  Again they were not
out of the Hebrew fountain (we speak of the Latin Translations of the
Old Testament) but out of the Greek stream, therefore the Greek being
not altogether clear, the Latin derived from it must needs be muddy.
This moved S. Jerome a most learned father, and the best linguist
without controversy, of his age, or of any that went before him, to
undertake the translating of the Old Testament, out of the very
fountain with that evidence of great learning, judgment, industry,
and faithfulness, that he had forever bound the Church unto him, in a
debt of special remembrance and thankfulness.</font></font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><span lang="en-US">Now
through the Church were thus furnished with Greek and Latin
Translations, even before the faith of CHRIST was generally embraced
in the Empire; (for the learned know that even in S. Jerome's time,
the Consul of Rome and his wife were both Ethnics, and about the same
time the greatest part of the Senate also) [S. Jerome. Marcell.Zosim]
yet for all that the godly-learned were not content to have the
Scriptures in the Language which they themselves understood, Greek
and Latin, (as the good Lepers were not content to fare well
themselves, but acquainted their neighbors with the store that God
had sent, that they also might provide for themselves) [2 Kings 7:9]
but also for the behoof and edifying of the unlearned which hungered
and thirsted after righteousness, and had souls to be saved as well
as they, they provided Translations into the vulgar for their
Countrymen, insomuch that most nations under heaven did shortly after
their conversion, hear CHRIST speaking unto them in their mother
tongue, not by the voice of their Minister only, but also by the
written word translated.  If any doubt hereof, he may be satisfied by
examples enough, if enough will serve the turn.  First S. Jerome
saith, Multarum gentium linguis Scriptura ante translata, docet falsa
esse quae addita sunt, etc. i.e. &quot;The Scripture being translated
before in the languages of many Nations, doth show that those things
that were added (by Lucian and Hesychius) are false.&quot; [S.
Jerome. praef. in 4::Evangel.]  So S. Jerome in that place.  The same
Jerome elsewhere affirmeth that he, the time was, had set forth the
translation of the Seventy suae linguae hominibus, i.e., for his
countrymen of Dalmatia [S. Jerome. Sophronio.]  Which words not only
Erasmus doth understand to purport, that S. Jerome translated the
Scripture into the Dalmatian tongue, but also Sixtus Senensis [Six.
Sen. lib 4], and Alphonsus a` Castro [Alphon. lb 1 ca 23] (that we
speak of no more) men not to be excepted against by them of Rome, do
ingenuously confess as much.  So, S. Chrysostom that lived in S.
Jerome's time, giveth evidence with him:  &quot;The doctrine of S.
John [saith he] did not in such sort [as the Philosophers' did]
vanish away: but the Syrians, Egyptians, Indians, Persians,
Ethiopians, and infinite other nations being barbarous people
translated it into their [mother] tongue, and have learned to be
[true] Philosophers,&quot; he meaneth Christians. [S. Chrysost. in
Johan. cap.I. hom.I.]  To this may be added Theodoret, as next unto
him, both for antiquity, and for learning.  His words be these,
&quot;Every Country that is under the Sun, is full of these words (of
the Apostles and Prophets) and the Hebrew tongue [he meaneth the
Scriptures in the Hebrew tongue] is turned not only into the Language
of the Grecians, but also of the Romans, and Egyptians, and Persians,
and Indians, and Armenians, and Scythians, and Sauromatians, and
briefly into all the Languages that any Nation useth. [Theodor. 5.
Therapeut.]  So he.  In like manner, Ulfilas is reported by Paulus
Diaconus and Isidor (and before them by Sozomen) to have translated
the Scriptures into the Gothic tongue: [P. Diacon. li. 12.]  John
Bishop of Sevil by Vasseus, to have turned them into Arabic, about
the year of our Lord 717; [Vaseus in Chron. Hispan.]  Bede by
Cistertiensis, to have turned a great part of them into Saxon: Efnard
by Trithemius, to have abridged the French Psalter, as Beded had done
the Hebrew, about the year 800: King Alfred by the said
Cistertiensis, to have turned the Psalter into Saxon: [Polydor. Virg.
5 histor.] Methodius by Aventinus (printed at Ingolstadt) to have
turned the Scriptures into Slavonian: [Aventin. lib. 4.]  Valdo,
Bishop of Frising by Beatus Rhenanus, to have caused about that time,
the Gospels to be translated into Dutch rhythm, yet extant in the
Library of Corbinian: [Circa annum 900. B. Rhenan. rerum German. lib
2.]  Valdus, by divers to have turned them himself into French, about
the year 1160:  Charles the Fifth of that name, surnamed the Wise, to
have caused them to be turned into French, about 200 years after
Valdus his time, of which translation there be many copies yet
extant, as witnesseth Beroaldus.  Much about that time, even in our
King Richard the second's days, John Trevisa translated them into
English, and many English Bibles in written hand are yet to be seen
with divers, translated as it is very probable, in that age.  So the
Syrian translation of the New Testament is in most learned men's
Libraries, of Widminstadius his setting forth, and the Psalter in
Arabic is with many, of Augustinus Nebiensis' setting forth.  So
Postel affirmeth, that in his travel he saw the Gospels in the
Ethiopian tongue; And Ambrose Thesius allegeth the Pslater of the
Indians, which he testifieth to have been set forth by Potken in
Syrian characters.  So that, to have the Scriptures in the mother
tongue is not a quaint conceit lately taken up, either by the Lord
Cromwell in England, [Thuan.] or by the Lord Radevile in Polony, or
by the Lord Ungnadius in the Emperor's dominion, but hath been
thought upon, and put in practice of old, even from the first times
of the conversion of any Nation; no doubt, because it was esteemed
most profitable, to cause faith to grow in men's hearts the sooner,
and to make them to be able to say with the words of the Psalms, &quot;As
we have heard, so we have seen.&quot; [Ps 48:8]</span></font></font></p>

the Church of Rome would seem at the length to bear a motherly
affection towards her children, and to allow them the Scriptures in
their mother tongue:  but indeed it is a gift, not deserving to be
called a gift, an unprofitable gift: [Sophecles] they must first get
a licence in writing before they may use them, and to get that, they
must approve themselves to their Confessor, that is, to be such as
are, if not frozen in the dregs, yet soured with the leaven of their
superstition.  Howbeit, it seemed too much to Clement the Eighth that
there should be any Licence granted to have them in the vulgar
tongue, and therefore he overruleth and frustrateth the grant of Pius
the Fourth. [See the observation (set forth by Clemen. His authority)
upon the 4. rule of Pius the 4. his making in the index, lib. prohib.
pag. 15. ver. 5.]  So much are they afraid of the light of the
Scripture, (Lucifugae Scripturarum, as Tertulian speaketh) that they
will not trust the people with it, no not as it is set forth by their
own sworn men, no not with the Licence of their own Bishops and
Inquisitors.  Yea, so unwilling they are to communicate the
Scriptures to the people's understanding in any sort, that they are
not ashamed to confess, that we forced them to translate it into
English against their wills.  This seemeth to argue a bad cause, or a
bad conscience, or both.  Sure we are, that it is not he that hath
good gold, that is afraid to bring it to the touchstone, but he that
hath the counterfeit; [Tertul. de resur. carnis.] neither is it the
true man that shunneth the light, but the malefactor, lest his deeds
should be reproved [John 3:20]: neither is it the plaindealing
Merchant that is unwilling to have the weights, or the meteyard
brought in place, but he that useth deceit.  But we will let them
alone for this fault, and return to translation.</span></font></font></p>

AND OF OUR ADVERSARIES AGAINST THIS WORK</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Many
men's mouths have been open a good while (and yet are not stopped)
with speeches about the Translation so long in hand, or rather
perusals of Translations made before:  and ask what may be the
reason, what the necessity of the employment:  Hath the Church been
deceived, say they, all this while?  Hath her sweet bread been
mingled with leaven, here silver with dross, her wine with water, her
milk with lime? (Lacte gypsum male miscetur, saith S. Ireney,) [S.
Iren. 3. lib. cap. 19.]  We hoped that we had been in the right way,
that we had the Oracles of God delivered unto us, and that though all
the world had cause to be offended and to complain, yet that we had
none.  Hath the nurse holden out the breast, and nothing but wind in
it?  Hath the bread been delivered by the fathers of the Church, and
the same proved to be lapidosus, as Seneca speaketh? What is it to
handle the word of God deceitfully, if this be not? Thus certain
brethren.  Also the adversaries of Judah and Jerusalem, like
Sanballat in Nehemiah, mock, as we hear, both the work and the
workmen, saying; &quot;What do these weak Jews, etc. will they make
the stones whole again out of the heaps of dust which are burnt? 
although they build, yet if a fox go up, he shall even break down
their stony wall.&quot; [Neh 4:3]  Was their Translation good before?
Why do they now mend it?  Was it not good?  Why then was it obtruded
to the people?  Yea, why did the Catholics (meaning Popish Romanists)
always go in jeopardy, for refusing to go to hear it?  Nay, if it
must be translated into English, Catholics are fittest to do it. They
have learning, and they know when a thing is well, they can manum de
tabula.  We will answer them both briefly: and the former, being
brethren, thus, with S. Jerome, &quot;Damnamus veteres?  Mineme, sed
post priorum studia in domo Domini quod possums laboramus.&quot; [S.
Jerome. Apolog. advers. Ruffin.]  That is, &quot;Do we condemn the
ancient?  In no case: but after the endeavors of them that were
before us, we take the best pains we can in the house of God.&quot;
As if he said, Being provoked by the example of the learned men that
lived before my time, I have thought it my duty, to assay whether my
talent in the knowledge of the tongues, may be profitable in any
measure to God's Church, lest I should seem to laboured in them in
vain, and lest I should be thought to glory in men, (although
ancient,) above that which was in them.  Thus S. Jerome may be
thought to speak.</font></font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><span lang="en-US">And
to the same effect say we, that we are so far off from condemning any
of their labors that travailed before us in this kind, either in this
land or beyond sea, either in King Henry's time, or King Edward's (if
there were any translation, or correction of a translation in his
time) or Queen Elizabeth's of ever renowned memory, that we
acknowledge them to have been raised up of God, for the building and
furnishing of his Church, and that they deserve to be had of us and
of posterity in everlasting remembrance.  The judgment of Aristotle
is worthy and well known:  &quot;If Timotheus had not been, we had
not had much sweet music; but if Phrynis [Timotheus his master] had
not been, we had not had Timotheus.&quot;  Therefore blessed be they,
and most honoured be their name, that break the ice, and giveth onset
upon that which helpeth forward to the saving of souls.  Now what can
be more available thereto, than to deliver God's book unto God's
people in a tongue which they understand? Since of a hidden treasure,
and of a fountain that is sealed, there is no profit, as Ptolemy
Philadelph wrote to the Rabbins or masters of the Jews, as witnesseth
Epiphanius: [S. Epiphan. loco ante citato.] and as S. Augustine
saith; &quot;A man had rather be with his dog than with a stranger
(whose tongue is strange unto him).&quot; [S. Augustin. lib. 19. de
civil. Dei. c. 7.]  Yet for all that, as nothing is begun and
perfected at the same time, and the later thoughts are thought to be
the wiser:  so, if we building upon their foundation that went before
us, and being holpen by their labours, do endeavor to make that
better which they left so good; no man, we are sure, hath cause to
mislike us; they, we persuade ourselves, if they were alive, would
thank us.  The vintage of Abienzer, that strake the stroke:  yet the
gleaning of grapes of Ephraim was not to be despised.  See Judges
8:2.  Joash the king of Israel did not satisfy himself, till he had
smitten the ground three times; and yet he offended the Prophet, for
giving over then. [2 Kings 13:18-19] Aquila, of whom we spake before,
translated the Bible as carefully, and as skilfully as he could; and
yet he thought good to go over it again, and then it got the credit
with the Jews, to be called accurately done, as Saint Jerome
witnesseth. [S. Jerome. in Ezech. cap. 3.]  How many books of profane
learning have been gone over again and again, by the same
translators, by others?  Of one and the same book of Aristotle's
Ethics, there are extant not so few as six or seven several
translations.  Now if this cost may be bestowed upon the gourd, which
affordeth us a little shade, and which today flourisheth, but
tomorrow is cut down; what may we bestow, nay what ought we not to
bestow upon the Vine, the fruit whereof maketh glad the conscience of
man, and the stem whereof abideth forever?  And this is the word of
God, which we translate. &quot;What is the chaff to the wheat, saith
the Lord?&quot; [Jer 23:28] Tanti vitreum, quanti verum margaritum
(saith Tertullian,) [Tertul. ad Martyr.] if a toy of glass be of that
reckoning with us, how ought we to value the true pearl? [Jerome. ad
Salvin.]  Therefore let no man's eye be evil, because his Majesty's
is good; neither let any be grieved, that we have a Prince that
seeketh the increase of the spiritual wealth of Israel (let
Sanballats and Tobiahs do so, which therefore do bear their just
reproof) but let us rather bless God from the ground of our heart,
for working this religious care in him, to have the translations of
the Bible maturely considered of and examined.  For by this means it
cometh to pass, that whatsoever is sound already (and all is sound
for substance, in one or other of our editions, and the worst of ours
far better than their authentic vulgar) the same will shine as gold
more brightly, being rubbed and polished; also, if anything be
halting, or superfluous, or not so agreeable to the original, the
same may be corrected, and the truth set in place.  And what can the
King command to be done, that will bring him more true honour than
this? and wherein could they that have been set a work, approve their
duty to the King, yea their obedience to God, and love to his Saints
more, than by yielding their service, and all that is within them,
for the furnishing of the work?  But besides all this, they were the
principal motives of it, and therefore ought least to quarrel it: 
for the very Historical truth is, that upon the importunate petitions
of the Puritans, at his Majesty's coming to this Crown, the
Conference at Hampton Court having been appointed for hearing their
complaints:  when by force of reason they were put from other
grounds, they had recourse at the last, to this shift, that they
could not with good conscience subscribe to the Communion book, since
it maintained the Bible as it was there translated, which was as they
said, a most corrupted translation. And although this was judged to
be but a very poor and empty shift; yet even hereupon did his Majesty
begin to bethink himself of the good that might ensue by a new
translation, and presently after gave order for this Translation
which is now presented unto thee. Thus much to satisfy our scrupulous
Brethren.</span></font></font></p>

<h1 class="western">AN ANSWER TO THE IMPUTATIONS OF OUR ADVERSARIES</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><span lang="en-US">Now
to the latter we answer; that we do not deny, nay we affirm and avow,
that the very meanest translation of the Bible in English, set forth
by men of our profession, (for we have seen none of theirs of the
whole Bible as yet) containeth the word of God, nay, is the word of
God.  As the King's speech, which he uttereth in Parliament, being
translated into French, Dutch, Italian, and Latin, is still the
King's speech, though it be not interpreted by every Translator with
the like grace, nor peradventure so fitly for phrase, nor so
expressly for sense, everywhere.  For it is confessed, that things
are to take their denomination of the greater part; and a natural man
could say, Verum ubi multa nitent in carmine, non ego paucis offendor
maculis, etc. [Horace.]  A man may be counted a virtuous man, though
he have made many slips in his life, (else, there were none virtuous,
for in many things we offend all) [James 3:2] also a comely man and
lovely, though he have some warts upon his hand, yea, not only
freckles upon his face, but also scars.  No cause therefore why the
word translated should be denied to be the word, or forbidden to be
current, notwithstanding that some imperfections and blemishes may be
noted in the setting forth of it.  For whatever was perfect under the
Sun, where Apostles or Apostolic men, that is, men endued with an
extraordinary measure of God's spirit, and privileged with the
privilege of infallibility, had not their hand?  The Romanists
therefore in refusing to hear, and daring to burn the Word
translated, did no less than despite the spirit of grace, from whom
originally it proceeded, and whose sense and meaning, as well as
man's weakness would enable, it did express.  Judge by an example or
two.  Plutarch writeth, that after that Rome had been burnt by the
Gauls, they fell soon to build it again: but doing it in haste, they
did not cast the streets, nor proportion the houses in such comely
fashion, as had been most slightly and convenient; [Plutarch in
Camillo.] was Catiline therefore an honest man, or a good patriot,
that sought to bring it to a combustion?  or Nero a good Prince, that
did indeed set it on fire?  So, by the story of Ezra, and the
prophecy of Haggai it may be gathered, that the Temple built by
Zerubbabel after the return from Babylon, was by no means to be
compared to the former built by Solomon (for they that remembered the
former, wept when they considered the latter) [Ezra 3:12]
notwithstanding, might this latter either have been abhorred and
forsaken by the Jews, or profaned by the Greeks?  The like we are to
think of Translations. The translation of the Seventy dissenteth from
the Original in many places, neither doth it come near it, for
perspicuity, gravity, majesty; yet which of the Apostles did condemn
it?  Condemn it? Nay, they used it, (as it is apparent, and as Saint
Jerome and most learned men do confess) which they would not have
done, nor by their example of using it, so grace and commend it to
the Church, if it had been unworthy of the appellation and name of
the word of God.  And whereas they urge for their second defence of
their vilifying and abusing of the English Bibles, or some pieces
thereof, which they meet with, for that heretics (forsooth) were the
Authors of the translations, (heretics they call us by the same right
that they call themselves Catholics, both being wrong) we marvel what
divinity taught them so.  We are sure Tertullian was of another mind:
 Ex personis probamus fidem, an ex fide personas? [Tertul. de
praescript. contra haereses.]  Do we try men's faith by their
persons?  we should try their persons by their faith.  Also S.
Augustine was of another mind:  for he lighting upon certain rules
made by Tychonius a Donatist, for the better understanding of the
word, was not ashamed to make use of them, yea, to insert them into
his own book, with giving commendation to them so far forth as they
were worthy to be commended, as is to be seen in S. Augustine's third
book De doctrina Christiana. [S. August. 3. de doct. Christ. cap.
30.]  To be short, Origen, and the whole Church of God for certain
hundred years, were of another mind: for they were so far from
treading under foot, (much more from burning) the Translation of
Aquila a Proselyte, that is, one that had turned Jew; of Symmachus,
and Theodotion, both Ebionites, that is, most vile heretics, that
they joined together with the Hebrew Original, and the Translation of
the Seventy (as hath been before signified out of Epiphanius) and set
them forth openly to be considered of and perused by all.  But we
weary the unlearned, who need not know so much, and trouble the
learned, who know it already.</span></font></font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><span lang="en-US">Yet
before we end, we must answer a third cavil and objection of theirs
against us, for altering and amending our Translations so oft;
wherein truly they deal hardly, and strangely with us. For to
whomever was it imputed for a fault (by such as were wise) to go over
that which he had done, and to amend it where he saw cause?  Saint
Augustine was not afraid to exhort S. Jerome to a Palinodia or
recantation; [S. Aug. Epist. 9.] and doth even glory that he seeth
his infirmities. [S. Aug. Epist. 8.]  If we be sons of the Truth, we
must consider what it speaketh, and trample upon our own credit, yea,
and upon other men's too, if either be any way an hindrance to it. 
This to the cause:  then to the persons we say, that of all men they
ought to be most silent in this case. For what varieties have they,
and what alterations have they made, not only of their Service books,
Portesses and Breviaries, but also of their Latin Translation?  The
Service book supposed to be made by S. Ambrose (Officium Ambrosianum)
was a great while in special use and request; but Pope Hadrian
calling a Council with the aid of Charles the Emperor, abolished it,
yea, burnt it, and commanded the Service book of Saint Gregory
universally to be used. [Durand. lib. 5. cap. 2.]  Well, Officium
Gregorianum gets by this means to be in credit, but doth it continue
without change or altering?  No, the very Roman Service was of two
fashions, the New fashion, and the Old, (the one used in one Church,
the other in another) as is to be seen in Pamelius a Romanist, his
Preface, before Micrologus.  the same Pamelius reporteth out
Radulphus de Rivo, that about the year of our Lord, 1277, Pope
Nicolas the Third removed out of the Churches of Rome, the more
ancient books (of Service) and brought into use the Missals of the
Friers Minorites, and commanded them to be observed there; insomuch
that about an hundred years after, when the above name Radulphus
happened to be at Rome, he found all the books to be new, (of the new
stamp).  Neither were there this chopping and changing in the more
ancient times only, but also of late:  Pius Quintus himself
confesseth, that every Bishopric almost had a peculiar kind of
service, most unlike to that which others had:  which moved him to
abolish all other Breviaries, though never so ancient, and privileged
and published by Bishops in their Dioceses, and to establish and
ratify that only which was of his own setting forth, in the year
1568.  Now when the father of their Church, who gladly would heal the
sore of the daughter of his people softly and slightly, and make the
best of it, findeth so great fault with them for their odds and
jarring; we hope the children have no great cause to vaunt of their
uniformity.  But the difference that appeareth between our
Translations, and our often correcting of them, is the thing that we
are specially charged with; let us see therefore whether they
themselves be without fault this way, (if it be to be counted a
fault, to correct) and whether they be fit men to throw stones at us:
O tandem maior parcas insane minori: they that are less sound
themselves, out not to object infirmities to others. [Horat.] If we
should tell them that Valla, Stapulensis, Erasmus, and Vives found
fault with their vulgar Translation, and consequently wished the same
to be mended, or a new one to be made, they would answer
peradventure, that we produced their enemies for witnesses against
them; albeit, they were in no other sort enemies, than as S. Paul was
to the Galatians, for telling them the truth [Gal 4:16]: and it were
to be wished, that they had dared to tell it them plainlier and
oftener.  But what will they say to this, that Pope Leo the Tenth
allowed Erasmus' Translation of the New Testament, so much different
from the vulgar, by his Apostolic Letter and Bull; that the same Leo
exhorted Pagnine to translate the whole Bible, and bare whatsoever
charges was necessary for the work? [Sixtus Senens.] Surely, as the
Apostle reasoneth to the Hebrews, that if the former Law and
Testament had been sufficient, there had been no need of the latter:
[Heb 7:11 and 8:7] so we may say, that if the old vulgar had been at
all points allowable, to small purpose had labour and charges been
undergone, about framing of a new.  If they say, it was one Pope's
private opinion, and that he consulted only himself; then we are able
to go further with them, and to aver, that more of their chief men of
all sorts, even their own Trent champions Paiva and Vega, and their
own Inquisitors, Hieronymus ab Oleastro, and their own Bishop
Isidorus Clarius, and their own Cardinal Thomas a Vio Caietan, do
either make new Translations themselves, or follow new ones of other
men's making, or note the vulgar Interpreter for halting; none of
them fear to dissent from him, nor yet to except against him.  And
call they this an uniform tenor of text and judgment about the text,
so many of their Worthies disclaiming the now received conceit?  Nay,
we will yet come nearer the quick: doth not their Paris edition
differ from the Lovaine, and Hentenius his from them both, and yet
all of them allowed by authority?  Nay, doth not Sixtus Quintus
confess, that certain Catholics (he meaneth certain of his own side)
were in such an humor of translating the Scriptures into Latin, that
Satan taking occasion by them, though they thought of no such matter,
did strive what he could, out of so uncertain and manifold a variety
of Translations, so to mingle all things, that nothing might seem to
be left certain and firm in them, etc.? [Sixtus 5. praefat. fixa
Bibliis.]  Nay, further, did not the same Sixtus ordain by an
inviolable decree, and that with the counsel and consent of his
Cardinals, that the Latin edition of the old and new Testament, which
the Council of Trent would have to be authentic, is the same without
controversy which he then set forth, being diligently corrected and
printed in the Printinghouse of Vatican?  Thus Sixtus in his Preface
before his Bible.  And yet Clement the Eighth his immediate
successor, published another edition of the Bible, containing in it
infinite differences from that of Sixtus, (and many of them weighty
and material) and yet this must be authentic by all means.  What is
to have the faith of our glorious Lord JESUS CHRIST with Yea or Nay,
if this be not?  Again, what is sweet harmony and consent, if this
be?  Therefore, as Demaratus of Corinth advised a great King, before
he talked of the dissensions of the Grecians, to compose his domestic
broils (for at that time his Queen and his son and heir were at
deadly feud with him) so all the while that our adversaries do make
so many and so various editions themselves, and do jar so much about
the worth and authority of them, they can with no show of equity
challenge us for changing and correcting.</span></font></font></p>

it is high time to leave them, and to show in brief what we proposed
to ourselves, and what course we held in this our perusal and survey
of the Bible.  Truly (good Christian Reader) we never thought from
the beginning, that we should need to make a new Translation, nor yet
to make of a bad one a good one, (for then the imputation of Sixtus
had been true in some sort, that our people had been fed with gall of
Dragons instead of wine, with whey instead of milk:) but to make a
good one better, or out of many good ones, one principal good one,
not justly to be excepted against; that hath been our endeavor, that
our mark.  To that purpose there were many chosen, that were greater
in other men's eyes than in their own, and that sought the truth
rather than their own praise.  Again, they came or were thought to
come to the work, not exercendi causa (as one saith) but exercitati,
that is, learned, not to learn:  For the chief overseer and [NOTE:
Greek letters omitted] under his Majesty, to whom not only we, but
also our whole Church was much bound, knew by his wisdom, which thing
also Nazianzen taught so long ago, that it is a preposterous order to
teach first and to learn after, yea that [NOTE: Greek letters
omitted] to learn and practice together, is neither commendable for
the workman, nor safe for the work. [Idem in Apologet.] Therefore
such were thought upon, as could say modestly with Saint Jerome, Et
Hebreaeum Sermonem ex parte didicimus, et in Latino pene ab ipsis
incunabulis etc. detriti sumus.  &quot;Both we have learned the
Hebrew tongue in part, and in the Latin we have been exercised almost
from our very cradle.&quot;  S. Jerome maketh no mention of the Greek
tongue, wherein yet he did excel, because he translated not the old
Testament out of Greek, but out of Hebrew.  And in what sort did
these assemble? In the trust of their own knowledge, or of their
sharpness of wit, or deepness of judgment, as it were in an arm of
flesh?  At no hand. They trusted in him that hath the key of David,
opening and no man shutting; they prayed to the Lord the Father of
our Lord, to the effect that S. Augustine did; &quot;O let thy
Scriptures be my pure delight, let me not be deceived in them,
neither let me deceive by them.&quot; [S. Aug. lib. II. Confess. cap.
2.]  In this confidence, and with this devotion did they assemble
together; not too many, lest one should trouble another; and yet
many, lest many things haply might escape them.  If you ask what they
had before them, truly it was the Hebrew text of the Old Testament,
the Greek of the New.  These are the two golden pipes, or rather
conduits, where-through the olive branches empty themselves into the
gold.  Saint Augustine calleth them precedent, or original tongues;
[S. August. 3. de doctr. c. 3. etc.]  Saint Jerome, fountains. [S.
Jerome. ad Suniam et Fretel.]  The same Saint Jerome affirmeth, [S.
Jerome. ad Lucinium, Dist. 9 ut veterum.] and Gratian hath not spared
to put it into his Decree, That &quot;as the credit of the old Books&quot;
(he meaneth of the Old Testament) &quot;is to be tried by the Hebrew
Volumes, so of the New by the Greek tongue,&quot; he meaneth by the
original Greek.  If truth be tried by these tongues, then whence
should a Translation be made, but out of them?  These tongues
therefore, the Scriptures we say in those tongues, we set before us
to translate, being the tongues wherein God was pleased to speak to
his Church by the Prophets and Apostles.  Neither did we run over the
work with that posting haste that the Septuagint did, if that be true
which is reported of them, that they finished it in 72 days; [Joseph.
Antiq. lib. 12.] neither were we barred or hindered from going over
it again, having once done it, like S. Jerome, if that be true which
himself reporteth, that he could no sooner write anything, but
presently it was caught from him, and published, and he could not
have leave to mend it: [S. Jerome. ad Pammac. pro libr. advers.
Iovinian.] neither, to be short, were we the first that fell in hand
with translating the Scripture into English, and consequently
destitute of former helps, as it is written of Origen, that he was
the first in a manner, that put his hand to write Commentaries upon
the Scriptures, [Sophoc. in Elect.] and therefore no marvel, if he
overshot himself many times. None of these things: the work hath not
been huddled up in 72 days, but hath cost the workmen, as light as it
seemeth, the pains of twice seven times seventy two days and more: 
matters of such weight and consequence are to be speeded with
maturity: for in a business of movement a man feareth not the blame
of convenient slackness. [S. Chrysost. in II. Thess. cap. 2.] 
Neither did we think much to consult the Translators or Commentators,
Chaldee, Hebrew, Syrian, Greek or Latin, no nor the Spanish, French,
Italian, or Dutch; neither did we disdain to revise that which we had
done, and to bring back to the anvil that which we had hammered: but
having and using as great helps as were needful, and fearing no
reproach for slowness, nor coveting praise for expedition, we have at
length, through the good hand of the Lord upon us, brought the work
to that pass that you see.</span></font></font></p>

<h1 class="western">REASONS MOVING US TO SET DIVERSITY OF SENSES IN
THE MARGIN, WHERE THERE IS GREAT PROBABILITY FOR EACH</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Some
peradventure would have no variety of senses to be set in the margin,
lest the authority of the Scriptures for deciding of controversies by
that show of uncertainty, should somewhat be shaken.  But we hold
their judgment not to be sound in this point.  For though,
&quot;whatsoever things are necessary are manifest,&quot; as S.
Chrysostom saith, [S. Chrysost. in II. Thess. cap. 2.] and as S.
Augustine, &quot;In those things that are plainly set down in the
Scriptures, all such matters are found that concern Faith, Hope, and
Charity.&quot; [S. Aug. 2. de doctr. Christ. cap. 9.]  Yet for all
that it cannot be dissembled, that partly to exercise and whet our
wits, partly to wean the curious from the loathing of them for their
everywhere plainness, partly also to stir up our devotion to crave
the assistance of God's spirit by prayer, and lastly, that we might
be forward to seek aid of our brethren by conference, and never scorn
those that be not in all respects so complete as they should be,
being to seek in many things ourselves, it hath pleased God in his
divine providence, here and there to scatter words and sentences of
that difficulty and doubtfulness, not in doctrinal points that
concern salvation, (for in such it hath been vouched that the
Scriptures are plain) but in matters of less moment, that fearfulness
would better beseem us than confidence, and if we will resolve upon
modesty with S. Augustine, (though not in this same case altogether,
yet upon the same ground) Melius est debitare de occultis, quam
litigare de incertis, [S. Aug li. S. de Genes. ad liter. cap. 5.] &quot;it
is better to make doubt of those things which are secret, than to
strive about those things that are uncertain.&quot;  There be many
words in the Scriptures, which be never found there but once, (having
neither brother or neighbor, as the Hebrews speak) so that we cannot
be holpen by conference of places.  Again, there be many rare names
of certain birds, beasts and precious stones, etc. concerning the
Hebrews themselves are so divided among themselves for judgment, that
they may seem to have defined this or that, rather because they would
say something, than because they were sure of that which they said,
as S. Jerome somewhere saith of the Septuagint.  Now in such a case,
doth not a margin do well to admonish the Reader to seek further, and
not to conclude or dogmatize upon this or that peremptorily?  For as
it is a fault of incredulity, to doubt of those things that are
evident: so to determine of such things as the Spirit of God hath
left (even in the judgment of the judicious) questionable, can be no
less than presumption.  Therefore as S. Augustine saith, that variety
of Translations is profitable for the finding out of the sense of the
Scriptures: [S. Aug. 2. De doctr. Christian. cap. 14.] so diversity
of signification and sense in the margin, where the text is no so
clear, must needs do good, yea, is necessary, as we are persuaded. 
We know that Sixtus Quintus expressly forbiddeth, that any variety of
readings of their vulgar edition, should be put in the margin,
[Sixtus 5. praef. Bibliae.] (which though it be not altogether the
same thing to that we have in hand, yet it looketh that way) but we
think he hath not all of his own side his favorers, for this conceit.
 They that are wise, had rather have their judgments at liberty in
differences of readings, than to be captivated to one, when it may be
the other.  If they were sure that their high Priest had all laws
shut up in his breast, as Paul the Second bragged, [Plat. in Paulo
secundo.] and that he were as free from error by special privilege,
as the Dictators of Rome were made by law inviolable, it were another
matter; then his word were an Oracle, his opinion a decision. But the
eyes of the world are now open, God be thanked, and have been a great
while, they find that he is subject to the same affections and
infirmities that others be, that his skin is penetrable, and
therefore so much as he proveth, not as much as he claimeth, they
grant and embrace.</font></font></p>

<h1 class="western">REASONS INDUCING US NOT TO STAND CURIOUSLY UPON
AN IDENTITY OF PHRASING</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><span lang="en-US">Another
things we think good to admonish thee of (gentle Reader) that we have
not tied ourselves to an uniformity of phrasing, or to an identity of
words, as some peradventure would wish that we had done, because they
observe, that some learned men somewhere, have been as exact as they
could that way.  Truly, that we might not vary from the sense of that
which we had translated before, if the word signified that same in
both places (for there be some words that be not the same sense
everywhere) we were especially careful, and made a conscience,
according to our duty.  But, that we should express the same notion
in the same particular word; as for example, if we translate the
Hebrew or Greek word once by PURPOSE, never to call it INTENT; if one
where JOURNEYING, never TRAVELING; if one where THINK, never SUPPOSE;
if one where PAIN, never ACHE; if one where JOY, never GLADNESS, etc.
Thus to mince the matter, we thought to savour more of curiosity than
wisdom, and that rather it would breed scorn in the Atheist, than
bring profit to the godly Reader.  For is the kingdom of God to
become words or syllables?  why should we be in bondage to them if we
may be free, use one precisely when we may use another no less fit,
as commodiously?  A godly Father in the Primitive time showed himself
greatly moved, that one of newfangledness called [NOTE: Greek omitted
but was a dispute over the word for &quot;a bed&quot;] [Niceph.
Calist. lib.8. cap.42.] though the difference be little or none; and
another reporteth that he was much abused for turning &quot;Cucurbita&quot;
(to which reading the people had been used) into &quot;Hedera&quot;.
[S. Jerome in 4. Ionae. See S. Aug: epist. 10.]  Now if this happens
in better times, and upon so small occasions, we might justly fear
hard censure, if generally we should make verbal and unnecessary
changings.  We might also be charged (by scoffers) with some unequal
dealing towards a great number of good English words. For as it is
written of a certain great Philosopher, that he should say , that
those logs were happy that were made images to be worshipped; for
their fellows, as good as they, lay for blocks behind the fire: so if
we should say, as it were, unto certain words, Stand up higher, have
a place in the Bible always, and to others of like quality, Get ye
hence, be banished forever, we might be taxed peradventure with S.
James his words, namely, &quot;To be partial in ourselves and judges
of evil thoughts.&quot; Add hereunto, that niceness in words was
always counted the next step to trifling, and so was to be curious
about names too: also that we cannot follow a better pattern for
elocution than God himself; therefore he using divers words, in his
holy writ, and indifferently for one thing in nature: [see Euseb. li.
12. ex Platon.] we, if we will not be superstitious, may use the same
liberty in our English versions out of Hebrew and Greek, for that
copy or store that he hath given us.  Lastly, we have on the one side
avoided the scrupulosity of the Puritans, who leave the old
Ecclesiastical words, and betake them to other, as when they put
WASHING for BAPTISM, and CONGREGATION instead of CHURCH: as also on
the other side we have shunned the obscurity of the Papists, in their
AZIMES, TUNIKE, RATIONAL, HOLOCAUSTS, PRAEPUCE, PASCHE, and a number
of such like, whereof their late Translation is full, and that of
purpose to darken the sense, that since they must needs translate the
Bible, yet by the language thereof, it may be kept from being
understood.  But we desire that the Scripture may speak like itself,
as in the language of Canaan, that it may be understood even of the
very vulgar.</span></font></font></p>

other things we might give thee warning of (gentle Reader) if we had
not exceeded the measure of a Preface already.  It remaineth, that we
commend thee to God, and to the Spirit of his grace, which is able to
build further than we can ask or think.  He removeth the scales from
our eyes, the vail from our hearts, opening our wits that we may
understand his word, enlarging our hearts, yea correcting our
affections, that we may love it to the end.  Ye are brought unto
fountains of living water which ye digged not; do not cast earth into
them with the Philistines, neither prefer broken pits before them
with the wicked Jews. [Gen 26:15. Jer 2:13.]  Others have laboured,
and you may enter into their labours; O receive not so great things
in vain, O despise not so great salvation! Be not like swine to tread
under foot so precious things, neither yet like dogs to tear and
abuse holy things.  Say not to our Saviour with the Gergesites,
Depart out of our coast [Matt 8:34]; neither yet with Esau sell your
birthright for a mess of pottage [Heb 12:16].  If light be come into
the world, love not darkness more than light; if food, if clothing be
offered, go not naked, starve not yourselves.  Remember the advice of
Nazianzene, &quot;It is a grievous thing&quot; (or dangerous) &quot;to
neglect a great fair, and to seek to make markets afterwards:&quot;
also the encouragement of S. Chrysostom, &quot;It is altogether
impossible, that he that is sober&quot; (and watchful) &quot;should
at any time be neglected:&quot; [S. Chrysost. in epist. ad Rom. cap.
14. oral. 26.] Lastly, the admonition and menacing of S. Augustine,
&quot;They that despise God's will inviting them, shall feel God's
will taking vengeance of them.&quot; [S. August. ad artic. sibi falso
object. Artic. 16.]  It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of
the living God; [Heb 10:31] but a blessed thing it is, and will bring
us to everlasting blessedness in the end, when God speaketh unto us,
to hearken; when he setteth his word before us, to read it; when he
stretcheth out his hand and calleth, to answer, Here am I, here we
are to do thy will, O God. The Lord work a care and conscience in us
to know him and serve him, that we may be acknowledged of him at the
appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom with the holy Ghost, be
all praise and thanksgiving.</font></font></p>
